# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** A kid sits down, does a lesson, practices, and the parent can see exactly what their child understands and what they don't — without any accounts or setup friction.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Curriculum & Content

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Curriculum & Content)
Plan: 1 of ? in current phase (02-01 complete)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-05-13 -- Plan 02-01 complete (types, db narrowing, test wiring)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~30 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~1 hour

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~35min), 01-02 (~25min)
- Trend: on pace

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Dexie chosen as stack (iPad web, no native)
- [Init]: iOS Safari audio unlock pattern is load-bearing — must be established in Phase 3 before any narration work
- [Init]: PWA/offline deferred to Phase 6 to avoid interfering with iterative development
- [01-01]: BrowserRouter imported from 'react-router' (v7 unified, not react-router-dom)
- [01-01]: Stub screens use height:100dvh inline style — Tailwind h-screen resolves to 100vh
- [01-01]: fake-indexeddb wired in src/test/setup.ts — no per-test mock needed
- [01-02]: RemyFox className prop interface frozen — Phase 3 replaces internals with Lottie
- [01-02]: ParentScreen has no PIN gate — deferred to Phase 5
- [02-01]: Topic union is canonical source of truth — db.ts imports from curriculum/types.ts
- [02-01]: curriculum.test.ts intentionally RED until Plan 02 ships index.ts + curriculum.json

### Pending Todos
